A Preset is just a set of keywords with a unique name. You can create these sets via _Edit -> Presets_ menu.

<p>
  <img alt="Presets" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/presets/presets.png" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

As you can see on the picture above, it's dead simple. Preset "Mountains" has 9 keywords and it belongs to the group "Nature". That's all.

<br />

To create preset you just click "Add new" and fill in what is needed:

<p>
  <img alt="Add preset" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/presets/add-preset.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

And what you can do with preset is to insert it into keywords in a number of ways.

<h3>From the context menu</h3>

You can do it from the context menu "Insert preset" of the keywords field.

<p>
  <img alt="Insert preset" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/presets/insert-preset.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<h3>From the keyword</h3>

If the keyword "looks like" the name of existing preset, you can "expand" it to preset. Better see the example.

<p>
  <img alt="Expand preset" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/presets/expand-preset.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<h3>From the autocompletion</h3>

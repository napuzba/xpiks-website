Xpiks can help you to fill keywords from similar images from microstocks or from your local files. Currently only Shutterstock, Fotolia and iStock are supported. In order to do so you click "Suggest keywords" below _Keywords_ field or through "More" menu.

<p>
  <img alt="Suggest keywords" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/keywording/suggest-keywords.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

When you select results on the left, keywords common to all selected artworks will appear on the right in the "Suggested" section. Keywords that are not common to majority of the selected artworks will appear in the "Other" section. Usually you want to look through all of them and remove some "suggested" keywords and add some "other" keywords.

<h4>Local files suggestion</h4>

Xpiks indexes all files you ever opened and it allows searching through them as you would search using microstocks websites. Just select **Local files** in dropdown on the right and you don't need internet to use "Suggest keywords" anymore.

<br />

Also you can repeat suggestion and add keywords many times from this dialog without closing it.

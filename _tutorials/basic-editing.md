You can fill in _Title_, _Description_ and _Keywords_ for each artwork in Xpiks. There're are several ways to do it:

<h3>In the main window:</h3>

Files initially are opened in the <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/interface-mainview/">main window</a> of the program. You can do all the editings right there:

<p>
  <img alt="Main window editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/getting-started/main-view-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

<h3>In the single editing view:</h3>

You can open one file in the <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/interface-single-view/">single artwork editing view</a>. Just double-click the image or use artwork's context menu:

<p>
  <img alt="Main window editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/getting-started/single-view-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

<h3>In the multiple editing view:</h3>

Also sometimes it's handy to edit multiple similar images at once. To do that you need select images you want to edit and press "Edit" toolbar button. You will see <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/interface-multiple-view/">multiple editing view</a>:

<p>
  <img alt="Multiple editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/getting-started/multiple-view-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />

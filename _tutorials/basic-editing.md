Most simple metadata required to be present in artworks is the _Title_, _Description_ and _Keywords_. These fields are available for editing for each artwork opened in Xpiks in multiple views.

You can open these fields in the main view of the program:

<p>
  <img alt="Main window editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/getting-started/main-view-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

or you can open file in the single artwork editing view. Just double-click the image or use artwork's context menu:

<p>
  <img alt="Main window editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/getting-started/single-view-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

Also sometimes it's handy to edit multiple similar images at once. To do that you need select images you want to edit and press "Edit" toolbar button:

<p>
  <img alt="Multiple editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/getting-started/multiple-view-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />

QuickBuffer is an advanced clipboard in Xpiks. You can copy, paste and edit structured metadata from and to artworks or different <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/intro-editing/">editing views</a>.

Most simple usage can be shown below. You can just fill in metadata and paste it to different artworks. In order to paste from QuickBuffer, place where you paste it should be "active" (e.g. contain cursor).

<p>
  <img alt="QuickBuffer overview" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/quickbuffer/overview.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

But manual entry is not only what you would expect to do with clipboard. So you can copy to QuickBuffer from different places like context menus or buttons.

<h4>Example #1 - moving metadata to batch editing view</h4>

<p>
  <img alt="QuickBuffer to batch" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/quickbuffer/move-to-batch.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

<h4>Example #2 - moving metadata to single editing view</h4>

<p>
  <img alt="QuickBuffer to single" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/quickbuffer/move-to-single.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

Also you have "Copy to QuickBuffer" context menu in artworks previews in editing modes.

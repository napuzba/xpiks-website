If you're in the <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/interface-mainview/">main view</a> you can select files and press "Edit" button. This is how you start editing multiple files at once. In order to apply changes you press "Save" button.

<p>
  <img alt="Multiple editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/getting-started/multiple-view-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

If some of the files already had _Title_, _Description_ or _Keywords_ prefilled, **Xpiks will show common metadata** in multiple editing view:

- _Title_ will be prefilled if non-empty titles of selected artworks are the same
- _Description_ will be prefilled if non-empty descriptions of selected artworks are the same
- _Keywords_ will contain common keywords that are found in the selected artworks

<p>
  <img alt="Combining artworks" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/batch-editing/combining-artworks.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

In the example above you can see that all three artworks have _same Description_ but _different Title_. Also each has 2 common keywords ("common", "keywords") and 1 other keyword. When you select them for batch editing Xpiks understands that their _Description_ is the same and it shows it right away. Also Xpiks shows keywords common to all opened artworks.

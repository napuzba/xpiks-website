In order to add metadata to your artworks you need first to open them in Xpiks.

Most simple way to do that is to drag'n'drop them from outside. Xpiks will promt you a dialog to import metadata which is already stored in files.

Also you can click **Add files** or **Add directories** buttons and select files or directories separately.

Usually when you batch-edit artworks and apply changes, you overwrite previous metadata in artworks with what you entered in <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/interface-multiple-view/">batch edit view</a>.

Sometimes though you want just to append few keywords to a bunch of artworks. In Xpiks it could be done with "Only append new keywords" checkbox in batch edit view.

<p>
  <img alt="Append keywords" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/batch-editing/append-keywords.png" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

With this option ON, Xpiks will _not_ overwrite keywords but for each artwork will add keyowrds that you typed in _Keyowrds_ field.

<br />

<p>
  <img alt="Append keywords on" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/batch-editing/append-keywords-on.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

If you will turn this option OFF, the result would be quite different:

<p>
  <img alt="Append keywords off" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/batch-editing/append-keywords-off.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

As you can see, Xpiks just overwrites keywords in each artwork selected for batch editing.

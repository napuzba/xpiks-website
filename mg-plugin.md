# Locating a plugin

To find a plugin, you should look next to the general tabs in 1.4 release:

<img alt="Find a plugin" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/find-plugin.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

Also you can see it registered via [Tools -> Plugins -> Plugins manager] menu:

<img alt="Find a plugin" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/plugins-menu.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

# Usage

When added to Xpiks plugin registers few presets which can be opened via [Edit -> Presets] menu:

<img alt="Presets" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/presets.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

To use a plugin there should be some active artwork or editing place for it to work. Please note how buttons become active when there's an active artwork:

<img alt="Activation" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/activate-buttons.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

When it is active, simply pressing the button will insert a preset. Plugin will remember inserted presets and you will be able to remove them by next press of same button.

<img alt="Basic inserting" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/basic-inserting.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

When you press a button you can also undo last action completely via usual Xpiks Undo link:

<img alt="Basic inserting" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/insert-undo.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

Plugin is also available in single item editing mode

<img alt="Single editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/one-item-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

as well as multiple item editing mode

<img alt="Multiple editing" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/multiple-file-editing.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

Also you can use presets registered by plugin as usual Xpiks presets:

<img alt="As presets" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/insert-as-preset.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

# Additional

Last but not the least - convenient keywords adding. If you prefix keyword with tag name, it will jump into it's own list:

<img alt="Jumping" src="{{site.url}}/images/posts/maground-demo/keyword-jumping.gif" class="small-12 large-8" />

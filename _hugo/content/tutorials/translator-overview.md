Translator tab in Xpiks allows you to translate single words offline using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarDict">StarDict</a> dictionaries.

Because of the legal reasons Xpiks doesn't ship with any dictionaries preinstalled. You can easily find dictionaries online or use your own purchased dictionaries. Press "Add dictionary" in the dropdown to add local dictionaries. Afterwards just enter the word into the active input to translate it.

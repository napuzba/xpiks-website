Sometimes you accidentally add keywords to several artworks at once and forget to press "Undo" link. Fortunately Xpiks has a convenient way to delete odd keywords. Just select artworks which you want to clean up and find _"Delete keywords"_ in menus for selected artworks either from <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/interface-mainview/">main actions</a> or from menu _Edit -> Selected artworks_.

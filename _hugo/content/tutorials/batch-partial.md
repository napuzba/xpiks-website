Sometimes you want only to:

* set same _Title_ to multiple artworks at once
* clear _Description_ in multiple artworks at once
* add few _Keywords_ to multiple artworks at once

You can do all of that and even more in the <a href='{{< misc/rel "/tutorials/interface-multiple-view/" >}}'>multiple editing view</a>. It contains checkboxes next to each field like _Title_, _Description_ or _Keywords_ that allow to include or exclude changes done in these field when you will press "Save".

<p>
  <img alt="Checkboxes" src='{{< misc/rel "/images/tutorials/batch-editing/checkboxes.gif" >}}' class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

For example, if you uncheck the checkbox next to _Description_, when you will press "Save" changes that you made to _Description_ field will not be applied to artworks you are editing.

<p>
  <img alt="Partial changes" src='{{< misc/rel "/images/tutorials/batch-editing/partial-changes.gif" >}}' class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

Of course **you can mix those**: you can turn off everything but _Title_ or _Keywords_ etc.

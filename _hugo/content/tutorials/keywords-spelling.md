Xpiks checks spelling as you type and shows you spelling errors if spellchecking is turned ON in Settings. Please note how the keyword with wrong spelling got underlined red and "Fix spelling" link appeared on the bottom right corner.

When you have spelling mistakes, Xpiks shows you "Fix spelling" link (which is also accessible from "More" menu) near _Keywords_ field and it provides spelling suggestion for you. If you click on this link you can select these suggestions and replace your misspelled words.

Also if that's not a mistake but a legit word but unknown to Xpiks dictionary, you can add it to user dictionary. Just right-click it and select "Add to dictionary".

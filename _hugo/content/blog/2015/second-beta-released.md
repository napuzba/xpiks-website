I'm proud to announce second release of Cross-platform image keywording software v1.0-beta2! Development took few days and now some ui glitches are fixed as well as logs support added in main window.

Short list of changes:

- Fix for keywords count not updated after CombinedEdit dialog and Import
- UI glitches fixes for keywords control (overlapping to scroll)
- Fix for label text in export dialog
- Fix for missing keywords validation on pasting keywords
- Added back logging in release version and logs screen

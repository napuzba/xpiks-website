I'm proud to announce Xpiks 1.5 release! This is a major release which took almost 10 month of development and testing. Mostly changes are focused on Video support and different improvements all over the app.

# Interface

Keeping in pace with <a href="{{site.url}}/2017/02/24/xpiks-14-detailed-features/"previous release</a> this one also brings many UI changes and improvements. Most notable ones are updated experience of main actions

<p>
  <img alt="Toolbar" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/interface/mainview-toolbar.png" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

and improved experience with many dialogs with the lists

<p>
  <img alt="Upload view" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/interface/upload.png" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

# Video

Yes, now you can edit and upload video files just as photos and vectors! You will see a small icon saying that it's video in the corner.

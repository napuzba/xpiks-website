I'm proud to announce Xpiks 1.5 release! This is a major release which took almost 10 month of development and testing. Mostly changes are focused on Video support and different improvements all over the app.

# Interface

Keeping in pace with <a href="{{site.url}}/2017/02/24/xpiks-14-detailed-features/"previous release</a> this one also brings many UI changes and improvements. Most notable ones are updated experience of main actions

<p>
  <img alt="Toolbar" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/interface/mainview-toolbar.png" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

and improved experience with many dialogs with the lists

</p>

<br />

# Video

Yes, now you can edit and upload video files just as photos and vectors! You will see a small icon saying that it's video in the corner.

</p>

<br />

Although most microstocks do not read metadata from video files as of today, the will do that in not so distant future. Xpiks not only writes metadata to video files, but also it provides options to export metadata CSV (comma-separated values file) for microstocks which do not read it from video files. This functionality is available from main menu _Edit -> Selected artworks -> Export to CSV_ as well as from the actions toolbar in the main window.

</p>

# Presets improvements

One of the huge improvements for presets is that now it's possible to categorize them to groups which will be visible in the context menu. You can read more about that in <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/presets-groups/">Preset Groups Tutorial</a>.

<p>
  <img alt="Presets groups" src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorials/presets/groups.gif" class="small-12 large-12" />
</p>

<br />

Also now you can autocomplete presets in keywords field when you type along with keywords or separately. You can read more about that in <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/presets-autocomplete/">Preset Autocomplete Tutorial</a>.

<br />

# Session management

Want to continue working where you left last time when you opened Xpiks? Now this is possible! Just turn it ON and Xpiks will reopen files that you worked with previously.

<p>

</p>

<br />

That said, Xpiks now also supports automatic import of metadata. This is an experimental feature, but combined with session management it should really simplify work. If you don't want import to be automatic you can always turn it off in _Settings -> System -> Experimental settings_.

<br />

# Directories filtering

List of opened directories on the left has become more interactive now. You can easily filter files by clicking on the directory name. Multiselect is also available.

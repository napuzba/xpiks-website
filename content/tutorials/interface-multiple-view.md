<h3>Changes switches</h3>

If you edit multiple artworks at once Xpiks provides you with flexible options to <a href='{{< misc/rel "/tutorials/batch-partial/" >}}'>change selectively</a> _Title_, _Description_ or _Keywords_ in the selected artworks. You can control these changes with checkboxes on the left. All of them are turned on by default.

<h3>Selected artworks</h3>

Here you can find artworks that you have selected before for editing in the <a href='{{< misc/rel "/tutorials/interface-mainview/" >}}'>Main window</a>. When you will press _Save_ button changes will be applied only to these artworks.

When you select artworks for mutliple editing Xpiks combines their metadata to show you <a href='{{< misc/rel "/tutorials/batch-basic/" >}}'>common metadata</a> they have. By default this common metadata is calculated from all images but using these tools you can recombine metadata only from the artworks you will select. Also you have possibility to remove them of the from multiple editing or to copy current metadata to QuickBuffer.

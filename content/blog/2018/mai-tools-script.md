Xpiks partners from [Mai Tools](http://mai-tools.com) have something to share!

We have good news for all microstockers who work with Adobe Illustrator. Now we have a useful script for preparing vector files for microstocks - Free Stock Master. This script automatically scans a vector file and fixes mistakes such as open paths, ghost shapes, bitmap, active brushes, symbols, effects, text etc. You can download this script for free on [MAI Tools website](http://mai-tools.com/free-stock-master)!

Have a look at the video on YouTube to understand how Stock Master script works - <a href="https://youtu.be/LR-oKZ7sSGc" target="_blank" >How to prepare vector files for microstocks.</a>

<p>I'm proud to announce first release of Cross-platform image keywording software v1.0-beta1! Development took 1.5 month and now you have nice gui wrapper over exiftool and curl. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Main features:</p>
<ul>
<li>ability to keyword your images as well as setting additional XMP/IPTC metadata (title, description, author)</li>
<li>work with separate images as well as directories</li>
<li>reading/writing of metadata with ExifTool</li>
<li>uploading selected images to list of FTP hosts (created by user) (upload uses Curl inside)</li>
<li>ability to upload vector eps files with images with same name (useful for illustrators)</li>
</ul>
